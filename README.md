# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis

A data-driven machine learning project to predict and analyze customer churn. This project helps businesses understand why customers leave and identify patterns to improve retention strategies.

## 🚀 Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on customer churn dataset.
  
- Data preprocessing: handling missing values, encoding, scaling.
  
- Visualizations to uncover insights about churn behavior.
  
- Model training and evaluation using classification algorithms.
  
- Performance metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix.

  
## 📉 Algorithms Used

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- (Add any others you implemented)

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Results

- Best performing model: Random Forest (Accuracy: XX%, Recall: XX%, etc.)
- Key insights:
  - Contract type and tenure are strong predictors of churn
  - Month-to-month customers are more likely to churn
